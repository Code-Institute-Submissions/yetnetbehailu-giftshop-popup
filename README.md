# GiftShop Pop-up

The live website can be viewed [here]()

### Overview

The general perception that personalized gifts tend to hold a higher emotional value, is usually due to the fact that personalization takes more thought than getting a plain gift. When receiving a personalized gift most people feel that the person who gave it to them put a lot of thought into the gift to make it more special & well-suited for them. *"Enhancing the whole experience & reinforcing the sentimental value."*
As such **GiftShop pop-up** a DIY handcraft startup association in Sweden, would like to partake in creating those cherishable moments by offering the Swedish locals; **Handcrafted products & workshop sessions**.
